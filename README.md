# penceo-challenge
A small web app in Angular that can handle user information from a JSON API.         On the entry page of the web app, a list of all users needs to be shown, along with a Leaflet map where all users should be correctly marked.         Clicking on a user on the list or on his/her marker on the map, should take us to the user’s full information page.         Each user must have his/her own information page, conveniently displaying all the information available alongside a Leaflet map marking the user’s location.
